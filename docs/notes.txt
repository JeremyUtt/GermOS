es = extra sector






Reading from Disk:
	ah = 2
	al = number of sectors to Read
	ch = 0 (serial number)
	cl = sector number
	dh = head number
	dl = drive number (auto set at boot)
	es:bx = (es offset by bx) = pointer to where we want to load sectors 
	int 0x13 = 
Example:
	mov ah, 2
	mov al, 1
	mov ch, 0
	mov cl, 2
	mov dh, 0
	mov dl, [diskNum]
	mov es, 0
	moc bx, 0x7e00
	int 0x13
